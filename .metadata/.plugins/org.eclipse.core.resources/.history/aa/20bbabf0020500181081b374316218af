	//Interests and opinion differences affect intimacy.
	//Personality and physical attraction affect passion only.
	//Commitment is affected by personality attraction.
	//Zero commitment does not mean that the person feels no loyalty to the relation - it is implicit in the other two traits.
	//Commitment amplifies passion/intimacy and can stand on its own.
	
	//Intimacy and passion are soft-capped at 50; every time they hit or would exceed it, they stay at 50 and an event is rolled for the person or relation to confess.
	//Both drop by 3 to 5 points every time this fails. Commitment has no soft cap.
	
	int intimacy; //This refers to the level of bonding - applies for friendship, knowledge sharing, etc.
	int passion; //This refers to attraction to the person's personality, mannerisms, and physical features - applies for sex, irrational siding on issues, etc.
	int commitment; //Implies the level of staying in the relationship simply because of other factors. For example, a member of a club may feel deep commitment towards their leader despite no other factors.
